_**This library is no longer maintained**_

An Arduino library for reading the DHT family of temperature and humidity sensors.    
Forked from [arduino-DHT](https://github.com/markruys/arduino-DHT)     
Original written by Mark Ruys, <mark@paracas.nl>.    

Why did I clone this library instead of forking the original repo and push the changes?
When I searched through Github for DHT libraries, I found a lot of them, some of them offers additional functions, some of them only basic temperature and humidity values. I wanted to combine all interesting functions into one library. In addition, none of the DHT libraries I found were written to work without errors on the ESP32. For ESP32 (a multi core/ multi processing SOC) task switching must be disabled while reading data from the sensor.    
Another problem I found is that many of the available libraries use the same naming (dht.h, dht.cpp), which easily leads to conflicts if different libraries are used for different platforms.    

_**According to users, the library works as well with DHT33 and DHT44 sensors. But as I do not own these sensors, I cannot test and confirm it. However, if you want to use this sensors, you can do so by using `setup(pin, DHTesp::DHT22)` and it should work.
Please give me feedback in the issues if you successfull use these sensors.
Thank you**_

The library is tested as well on ESP8266 and should work on AVR boards as well.    

Changes to the original library:
--------
- 2017-12-12: Renamed DHT class to DHTesp and filenames from dht.* to DHTesp.* to avoid conflicts with other libraries - beegee-tokyo, <beegee@giesecke.tk>.    
- 2017-12-12: Updated to work with ESP32 - beegee-tokyo, <beegee@giesecke.tk>.
